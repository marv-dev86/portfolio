          I'm married in 2008, my wife and I have 3 kids, we're members of the Church of Jesus Christ of later-day Saints. <br />
          
          I started to code in 2020 when the quarantine just started, I quickly get in love with coding and the great things you can do. Later that year I started my first coding project. <br />

          Since 2021 I'm learning REACT JS, NODE JS and SQL to become a Full Stack Developer. I hope to meet that goal this year. <br />
